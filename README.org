  _LigonLab_ 
Toolbox for working with/like Ethan Ligon

* Introduction 
This document is meant to both document and help set up a software
environment which will allow you to use tools employed by Ethan Ligon
(that's me) and various of his students and colleagues.  If you want
to be able to work with me you may find this package useful.  However,
you don't have to have a relationship with me to use this
package---you may find it independently useful, or useful as a first
step in replicating work done by others who have used this package.

* Git
This toolbox comes most naturally in the form of a =git= repository,
available on-line at
